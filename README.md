SMS Spam Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to implement a machine learning model for detecting SMS spam. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing both spam and non-spam (ham) SMS messages. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient spam detection system that can be used to filter out unwanted messages.

Features
Machine Learning Algorithm: The project uses a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham.

Dataset: The model is trained on a labeled dataset that includes examples of both spam and ham messages. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Preprocessing: Text data preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal, are applied to convert the raw SMS messages into a format suitable for training the machine learning model.

Evaluation Metrics: The project employs relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision) to assess the performance of the spam detection model.

Requirements
Dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

Acknowledgments
The project is inspired by the need to combat SMS spam and enhance user experience.
